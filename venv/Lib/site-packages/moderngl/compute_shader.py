        A Compute Shader is a Shader Stage that is used entirely for computing

        - Storage buffers can be bound using :py:meth:`Buffer.bind_to_storage_buffer`.
        - Uniform buffers can be bound using :py:meth:`Buffer.bind_to_uniform_block`.
        - Images can be bound using :py:meth:`Texture.bind_to_image`.

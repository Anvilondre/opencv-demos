<h1> Each week I implement different ideas using OpenCV.  </h1>  

**Week1:** Detect a rectangle and replace it with a honey badger image. Done!  
**Week2:** Detect an ArUco marker and replace it with a 3D-model (Augmented reality). Program detects all the markers  
       and finds angles of rotatios with respect to camera. Also added a nice class for camera calibration.  
**Week3:** Telegram bot that detects all the faces on a received picture and replaces them with  
       pre-made face masks. Done!
